# Front Royal Band Site
Front Royal (the band, not the town) now has a website.

This will be the homebase for the band that basically takes in every other service we actively use and puts it to use here.

## TODO
1. The Tour Dates section is too big once the padding is factored in. It works now because of the align-items property, but this might not be the same result after refactoring containers later.
2. Configure the SCSS
