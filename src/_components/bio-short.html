  Front Royal formed in 2014 with Justin Greger and Troy Vassalotti eager to get the band back together. It wasn't long
  until the old studio was reborn, they were churning out songs, and buying a 1994 Ford Econoline for summer tours.

  If there's one thing to take away from Front Royal, it's their persistent DIY attitude. Whether it's beefing up their
  own tour van or screen printing merch in the comfort of Justin's basement-turned-studio/practice space/house show
  venue, the band isn't afraid of a challenge. To prove it, they've extensively catalogued the band life on their band
  vlog.

  With two tours, 11 states, three EPs, and a 13-track LP under their belts, Front Royal knows no bounds and sees no end
  in sight. Their dedication has seen them share the stage with such bands as The Pink Spiders and Carousel Kings, while
  also headlining shows at Baltimore favorites The Ottobar and The Sidebar.
